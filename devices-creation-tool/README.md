# flespi.io devices bulk creation tool

This tool may help you to create many [devices](https://flespi.com/kb/device-virtual-instance-of-real-tracker) in your [flespi.io](https://flespi.io/) account. You have to provide a [flespi token](https://flespi.com/kb/tokens-access-keys-to-flespi-platform) to perform all operations.

This wizard-like tool can create a lot of devices at once with the specified [device type](https://flespi.io/docs/#/gw/!/protocols/get_protocols_protocol_selector_device_types_devtypes_selector).

You have to provide a set of ident values and the same number of name values. You also may provide optional phone values for devices, if selected device type supports it.

At the last stage, you may get a cURL command line to create devices (first button) or to create it directly from this page with the second button.

See the screenshot of the process:
